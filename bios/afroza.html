            <h2>Afroza Sultana</h2>
            <h3>PhD Candidate</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/sis/files/sis/afrozasultana_cv_0.pdf" target="_blank">Afroza</a> is a PhD student in the
            <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/sis/" target="_blank">School of Information Studies</a>,
            <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">McGill University</a>. She is working with Dr.
            <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/sis/people/faculty/moffatt" target="_blank">Karyn Moffatt</a>.
            Before joining ACT Lab, Afroza finished her Masterâ€™s in
            <a href="https://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from
            <a href="http://umanitoba.ca/" target="_blank">University of Manitoba</a>, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, and she finished
            her Bachelor&#8217;s in <a href="http://ece.northsouth.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from
            <a href="http://www.northsouth.edu/" target="_blank">North South University</a>, Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p>

            <p>Afroza&#8217;s research area is Human Computer Interaction, focusing on understanding the target
            selection (e.g., selecting a button or a link) behaviour of older adults on touch-screen interfaces. Studies
            showed that age related motor, cognitive and sensory declines may cause significant different target selection
            behaviour for older. As a result, many of them cannot take the full advantages of the current assistive technologies
            that are developed with touch-screen technologies. Her research, in particular, focuses on the three-dimensional
            properties of touch interaction of older adults during a target selection task on touch-screen interfaces. In addition,
            she is also investigating the impact of the finger properties such as finger size, angle, pressure, velocity, etc. on the
            performance of the target selection tasks, and how they differ from that of younger adults. The outcomes of her studies will
            be useful to develop novel performance evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the target selection behaviour of older
            adults on touch-screen interfaces. These novel measures can be used as the benchmarks for designing accessible assistive
            touch-screen technologies for older adults that can contribute to improve their individual and social lives.</p>
