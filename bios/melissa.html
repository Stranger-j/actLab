            Melissa is an undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelors
            of Arts and Science in Cognitive Science at McGill University. She
            joined the ACT lab to research and design accessible technologies for older
            adults. Previously, she has interned at the Montreal Neurological
            Institute and the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research
            (DSAIR) lab at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, where she focused
            on neuroplasticity and emotional learning tools for children with special needs respectively.
            Currently, Melissa's interests lie at the intersection of design,
            cognitive neuropsychology and HCI, with a particular enthusiasm for digital equity
            and accessibility.
