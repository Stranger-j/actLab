            Melissa is an undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelors
            of Arts and Science in Cognitive Science at McGill University. She
            joined the ACT lab to research and design user experiences that
            enhance accessibility and usability of smart devices for older
            adults. Previously, she has worked at the Montreal Neurological
            Institute and the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research
            (DSAIR) lab at Nanyang Technological University, where she focused
            on emotional learning tools for children with special needs.
            Currently, Melissa's interests lie at the intersection of design,
            psychology and HCI, with a particular enthusiasm for digital equity
            and accessibility.
