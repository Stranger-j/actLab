            Amira Ghenai is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the School of
            Information Studies at McGill University. Before that, Amira
            completed her PhD of Computer Science at the David R. Cheriton
            School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo. Amira received a
            Masters of Computing Sciences in Software Engineering from the
            University of Imperial College London. Her research interests
            include information retrieval, social media analysis, machine
            learning, misinformation, and accessibility for older adults. More
            specifically, she is interested in the research question of how
            search and social media interactions effect the human behavior in
            the health-related decision-making process. Currently, she is
            working on designing solutions to help older adults fight COVID-19
            misinformation. Amira has well-established research track record
            with notable conference publications (such as ACM CSCW, ACM CHIIR,
            and ACM ICTIR). She further served as program committee member and
            reviewer for top-tier conferences and journals (such as JMIR, ACM
            CSCW, and ACM WWW).
